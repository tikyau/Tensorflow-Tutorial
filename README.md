# TensorFlow Tutorial

Welcome to the TensorFlow Tutorial.

Please install TensorFlow on your computer before you arrive.

For this tutorial, you can do one of the following:

 1. [Install TensorFlow directly on your Mac.](install-mac-native.md)
*This is recommended*, as it installs the least amount on your computer
and will run the fastest.

 1. [Use Docker on Mac, running TensorFlow in a local
VM.](install-mac-docker.md) If for some reason you can't install
TensorFlow natively or already have Docker installed, you can try this.

 1. [Install TensorFlow directly on your Ubuntu/Linux
machine.](install-ubuntu.md)

_Note that TensorFlow is not currently supported natively on Windows._

If you run into trouble, our full install instrictions are available
on http://tensorflow.org.
